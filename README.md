# ⭐ Mini Project 2 ⭐

## Description & Overview
In this project, we are using the [ExchangeRate-API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/) to get the exchange rate between a base currency and an exchange currency for the last 30 days.
The base currency is USD, and the exchange currency is AUD.
I highlight the max and min exchange rates.

This project uses the ExchangeRate-API for retrieving information, the packages pandas and MatPlotLib.

## Getting Started
1) Clone this project
2) [Get an ExchangeRate-API API Key](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/)
    * After retrieving your key, please sign up for the Pro Free Trial.
    * It does not require card information and allows for historical data to be requested

3) Insert your API Key into the API_KEY variable in main.py
4) ```pip install -r requirements.txt ```
5 )In a terminal, run: ``` python main.py ```
